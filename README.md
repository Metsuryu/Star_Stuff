# Star Stuff
Space-themed RPG

Version 0.2004

This is my first actual project in C++ using Qt. 
It's supposed to be as simple as possible, with a fast and not too complicated gameplay, and an interesting story.

I am still building the "skeleton" for the actual game and there are a lot of placeholders for now. 
Everything is still in the very early stages and could change on the final version.
